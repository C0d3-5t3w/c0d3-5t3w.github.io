# Standalone dependancies:

* Golang

* Typescript

* Sass

* Php

* Make

# Standalone make commands and what they do ('make all' is enough):

* 'make go'    - get go packages

* 'make php'   - compiles php into html

* 'make ts'    - compiles typescript into javascript

* 'make sass'  - compiles scss into css

* 'make clean' - removes compiled files

* 'make run'   - runs go server with compiled files

* 'make all'   - runs all commands above in proper order

* 'make help'  - gives a help message
